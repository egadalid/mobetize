Swagger viewer icon should be shown in the top right corner of chrome.

If swagger viewer icon is not shown on the top right of chrome, enter url chrome://extensions/ in chrome. Find swagger-viewer. There is a slider in the box to turn it on and the icon would show (SW) on the top right of chrome.

Open smartOpen.json in github.

While viewing smartOpen.json content, click on swagger viewer icon in chrome. You will then see the json data turn into html.
